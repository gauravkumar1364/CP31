#  Competitive Programming – Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to my **Codeforces Competitive Programming Solutions** repository! This repo contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems that I've solved while improving my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.

---

##  About

This repository serves as a personal archive of all the Codeforces problems I've solved. It includes problems from different difficulty levels and topics, such as:

-  **Data Structures** – Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
-  **Algorithms** – Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Graph Traversal
-  **Mathematics** – Number Theory, Combinatorics, Probability
-  **Implementation & Logic Building**

Each solution is written with a focus on **clarity**, **efficiency**, and **readability**.
